Housekeeping Rules:
1. Be sure to Fetch + Pull frequently to get updated assets
2. Everyone will have a personal folder to store their works in progress in each file type. All finished renders ready for implementation should follow the follwing naming convention: "Lastname_Subject_DraftLetterPassNumber" Example: "Justice_Assault_A1", "Prieto_Grunt_B1".
Note: If you would like to make a pass at anothers' work, be sure to use the same Draft Letter they used for their draft as to indicate that it relates to that specific design. Example: Gus makes a pass on Ashley's grunt - "Llamas_Grunt_B2".
